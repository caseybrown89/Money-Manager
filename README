Money Manager

An app that keeps track of who you've lent or borrowed money from.

This app started as a project for a Human Computer Interaction class I took in the fall of 2011.  I wanted to experiment with Android development so an Android App was my semester project.

After a few months of not working on this app, I've decided to revisit it.  I want to refactor any bad code, make the UI much better looking, and submit it to the Android Market.

I would love any comments/suggestions/critiques of the app, code, etc.
